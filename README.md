## Simple Calculator (Test Driven Development Walkthrough)
This project demonstrates Test Driven Development (TDD) using a simple calculator in Java. The goal is to build two functions: add, which starts by adding two integers and then expands to handle multiple integers, and multiply, which follows a similar process. The development process follows TDD principles, where tests are written first and the code is implemented to make the tests pass.

To get started, clone the repository and ensure JUnit is included in your project dependencies. First, write unit tests for the add function to handle both two integers and multiple integers. Then, write tests for the multiply function to handle both two integers and multiple integers. Modify both functions accordingly to make the tests pass. Run the tests using Maven or Gradle to verify that both add and multiply behave as expected.
